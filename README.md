# Description

Super Mario is a renowned children's game that was first created in 1985. Inspired by this classic, myself and another team member embarked on a project to develop a game closely resembling Super Mario, but with a theme related to our lives during the Coronavirus pandemic. Our aim was to provide children with an engaging incentive to get vaccinated and contribute to the collective effort in overcoming the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Our game revolves around fighting the corona epidemic with the corona vaccine. Players must collect the vaccine power-ups to eliminate corona enemies and reach the end. It symbolizes the importance of vaccination in overcoming the pandemic.
